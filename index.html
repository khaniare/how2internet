    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This guide consists of various guides to multitude of
        topics. The following subjects as of now is subjective
        and we cannot provide a comprehensive list. Sorry! </p>

    <p>For now, search a topic via:</p> 
        <code>SUPER + F</code>

    <h1>Operating System</h1>
    <h3>Computers</h3>
    <p> By now, you're probably already in an ecosystem of either macOS or Windows. First thing is to find
        your needs. Are you working? Are you gaming? I won't give a list of what you need
        to think because there's a lot out there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is pretty much the main rule for picking your OS: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If your device is more than ~5 years old, Linux.</li>
        <li>If your device is fairly new, like maybe the last ~4 years, Windows.</li>
        <li>Apple Silicon Macs work best on macOS</li>
        <li>Apple Intel Macs work best on either Linux or Windows, but if your Mac is old, try linux first.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> If your device is new, you get personalized drivers, so changing your OS might give you generic drivers that aren't optimized.
        But don't worry. It's very rare to get no drivers at all!

        For Apple Intel Macs, it's easier to download Windows because of <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/bootcamp-assistant/welcome/mac">Boot Camp Assistant</a>
        But, Linux normally has better performance. <i>(at least in my case.)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Mobiles/Tablets</h3>
    <p><i> First things first, I expect you to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-android-root/awesome-android-root/blob/main/docs/rooting-guides/how-to-unlock-bootloader.md">unlock your bootloader</a>
        as we are going to talk about custom ROMs, but if you do not want to or cannot because you have a carrier-locked phone, 
        then skip this section completely, stay with the OS you're on.
    </p></i>
    <p>From my experience, If you got a new phone, I recommend staying on your OS. It's not worth it to change your ROM.
        The company that your phone came from has already tested rigorously on the specific ROM you are on right now, so trust them and use it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Custom ROMs on android can really bring back your phone to life. 
        There's a <i>lot</i> of custom ROMs to go through, so I recommend doing your own research. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Think of the following while researching ROMs supported on your phone:
    </p>
<ul> 
    <li>Does it have any Bugs?</li>
    <li>Does it seem like it aligns with my priorities?</li>
    <li>Does it have any specific features that I need.</li>
</ul>
<p> To check if there are ROMs for your specific vendor, search it up. There are also places like <a href="https://xdaforums.com/all-forums-by-manufacturer">XDA</a>
which is a vibrant community there to guide you to the right path.</p>

    <h1>Browser</h1>
    <p>There's a lot of browsers out there that you can use, but
        most of the population sticks with <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
        which makes sense. It's owned by <a href="https://about.google.com">Google</a> which your
        probably know. To get to the point, It doesn't matter what browser you use, if it works. The real matter is if matches your priorities.
    </p>
    <p>Think of the following priorities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Privacy</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Ai Features</li>
        <li>Customizability</li>
    </ul>
<p>Now that you’ve thought of the following, head over to <a href="https://www.browsers.to">browsers.to</a>
and filter specifically by the <b><u>sort</u></b> feature. I also recommend you to filter by <b><u>Operating System</u></b>.
</p>   
<i> do note: we don't say that this site's top #1 browser with filters is now your main browser to use forever. I recommend trying multiple
     browsers before picking your main browser. You might even need different browsers for different type of devices, but this is a pretty rare situation.
