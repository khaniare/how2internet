    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This guide consists of various guides to multitude of
        topics. The following subjects as of now is subjective
        and we cannot provide a comprehensive list. Sorry! </p>

    <p>For now, search a topic via:</p> 
        <code>SUPER + F</code>

    <h1>Operating System</h1>
    <h3>Computers</h3>
    <p> By now, you're probably already in an ecosystem of either macOS or Windows. First thing is to find
        your needs. Are you working? Are you gaming? I won't give a list of what you need
        to think because there's a lot out there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is pretty much the main rule for picking your OS: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If your device is more than ~5 years old, Linux.</li>
        <li>If your device is fairly new, like maybe the last ~4 years, Windows.</li>
        <li>Apple Silicon Macs work best on macOS</li>
        <li>Apple Intel Macs work best on either Linux or Windows, but if your Mac is old, try linux first.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> If your device is new, you get personalized drivers, so changing your OS might give you generic drivers that aren't optimized.
        But don't worry. It's very rare to get no drivers at all!

        For Apple Intel Macs, it's easier to download Windows because of <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/bootcamp-assistant/welcome/mac">Boot Camp Assistant</a>
        But, Linux normally has better performance. <i>(at least in my case.)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Mobiles/Tablets</h3>
    <p><i> First things first, I expect you to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-android-root/awesome-android-root/blob/main/docs/rooting-guides/how-to-unlock-bootloader.md">unlock your bootloader</a>
        as we are going to talk about custom ROMs, but if you do not want to or cannot because you have a carrier-locked phone, 
        then skip this section completely, stay with the OS you're on.
    </p></i>
    <p>From my experience, If you got a new phone, I recommend staying on your OS. It's not worth it to change your ROM.
        The company that your phone came from has already tested rigorously on the specific ROM you are on right now, so trust them and use it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Custom ROMs on android can really bring back your phone to life. 
        There's a <i>lot</i> of custom ROMs to go through, so I recommend doing your own research. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Think of the following while researching ROMs supported on your phone:
    </p>
<ul> 
    <li>Does it have any bugs?</li>
    <li>Does it seem like it aligns with my priorities?</li>
    <li>Does it have any specific features that I need.</li>
</ul>
<p> To check if there are ROMs for your specific vendor, search it up. There are also places like <a href="https://xdaforums.com/all-forums-by-manufacturer">XDA</a>
which is a vibrant community there to guide you to the right path of modding your phone.</p>

    <h1>Browser</h1>
    <p>There's a lot of browsers out there that you can use, but
        most of the population sticks with <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
        which makes sense. It's owned by <a href="https://about.google.com">Google</a> which your
        probably know. To get to the point, It doesn't matter what browser you use, if it works. The real matter is if matches your priorities.
    </p>
    <p>Think of the following priorities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Privacy</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Ai Features</li>
        <li>Customizability</li>
    </ul>
<p>Now that you’ve thought of the following, head over to <a href="https://www.browsers.to">browsers.to</a>
and filter specifically by the <b><u>sort</u></b> feature. I also recommend you to filter by <b><u>Operating System</u></b>.
</p>   
<i> do note: we don't say that this site's top #1 browser with filters is now your main browser to use forever. I recommend trying multiple
     browsers before picking your main browser. You might even need different browsers for different type of devices, but this is a pretty rare situation.

<h1>MFA, Passwords, You</h1>
<p>You, yes you. The internet is a place with a lot of websites, so making good passwords for your account is a thing you need
    to get used to. The bigger thing is 2FA'ing your accounts to keep them secure. Let's get into it—trust me it won't be that
    boring.
</p>
<p>First, get your saved passwords from all your accounts. This might take ~10 minutes or so to go through to every device to get your passwords.</p>
<p><b>You might even find old accounts that you don't use anymore. Don't forget these accounts, we will need this!</b></p>

<p>Once you got all or most of your accounts with your passwords, <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/passwords/">pick one of the following password managers</a> and stick with it.
</p>

<ul> 
    <li>I <i>personally</i> recommend <a href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a>.</li>  
</ul>

<p>Once you found your ideal password manager, you should import your passwords. You have two ways of doing so:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use your brain and manually enter all the accounts and passwords that you use, <i>the easy way.</i></li>
    <li>Research your way to find how to import your accounts and passwords, <i>the somewhat easier way if you find out how.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This process will take either a long or even longer time. Matters on how many accounts you have. </p>

<h3>Old Accounts</h3>
<p>Now, those old accounts you set to the side. Time to delete them. If you don't want to delete <i>some</i> of these accounts, it's fine, we'll get to that.
</p>

<h4>Deleting Accounts</h4>
<p>This section is for the accounts that you do <b>not care about</b>.
    Open <a href="https://justdeleteme.xyz">JustDeleteMe</a> and search up the service you made your account on. 
    Then, Follow the instructions. 
</p>

<h4>Non-deleted Accounts</h4>
<p><b><i>DO NOTE:</i> The info that is listed below is for hiding your accounts to PEOPLE, not large scaled platforms. These accounts are accounts should be abandoned.</b> 
    I cannot stress this enough!</p>

<p>Non-deleted accounts are accounts that you use. We are going to focus on the accounts that you
    use from time to time, but not your main account. These accounts are normally your <a href="https://thesocialcat.com/glossary/alt-alternate-account">alt</a> accounts.
</p>

<p> To make sure these accounts aren't going to be linked back to you, make sure to do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Delete any info on the account, including personal info. Even if it's fake info.</li>
    <li>Delete your profile picture if you have used it before anywhere, even if you feel like it's useless to do so.</li>
    <li>Use fake info if the service's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service">TOS</a> allows so.</li>
</ul>

<p>The point of faking your info is not for the "fun" of it. Make it somewhat believable if you're going to. You can use any AI to make fake info for you, but be sure to not show any red flags.
</p>
<p>If you have questions about this section or need more clarifying, I <b>highly</b> recommend reading this <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/06/10/stay-safe-but-stay-connected/#resources-to-help">short article</a>.

<h5>JustDeleteMe</h5>
<p>For the Future, download the JustDeleteMe Extension </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/just-delete-me/dlhckcablohllindinahbbpnfgblimoe">JustDeleteMe (Chromium)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/justdeleteme/">JustDeleteMe (Firefox)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Follow this guide to use JustDeleteMe:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pin the extension by right-clicking the extension.</li>
    <li>Follow the image below to see how difficult it is to delete your account on the site you are on.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MFA</h3>
<p><i>You should set 2FA for all your accounts as minimum. 2FA for all your accounts that support it is non-negotiable.</i> </p>
<p>
     But, sadly it's not that easy. 2FA isn't the strongest type of security, and to be really honest, if you were to get hacked, 
     2FA wouldn't stop the hacker. 
</p>

<p>So, 2FA for all your accounts doesn't seem all that good, what should I use? That's what we're going through in this section.
</p>

<h4>Types of MFA</h4>
<details>
    <summary style="color: #fff5bc;">Expand to see various MFA's</summary>
<ul>
<li>Passkeys/Fido2/WebAuthn</li>
<li>Hardware security keys</li>
<li>TOTP (Authenticator apps)</li>
<p>I personally recommend you to use <a href="https://ente.io/auth/">Ente</a>. It's completly free and on all major platforms.</p>
<li>SMS/Email codes</li>
<p>By all means, do NOT use SMS/Email as verification as it is the weakest way to secure you account.
    Only use SMS/Email codes if it's your last option.
</p>
</ul>
</details>

<p>While we <i>could</i> make a whole guide on this section, this part above is still in the making.</p>
<p>Instead, go over to <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/multi-factor-authentication/">this article</a> to read about MFA's.</p>
